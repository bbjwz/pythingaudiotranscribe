# pythingaudiotranscribe

This thing takes an audio stream, makes chunks from it and sends it to the Azure Speech service to transcribe it.

Currently it takes a fixed, hardcoded stream. It is also still missing pieces of transcribed text, so I guess not all the chunks are transcribed. Still need to figure this out.


I used this page a lot to learn how to deploy dockerized python to an Azure Container Registry from Github.
